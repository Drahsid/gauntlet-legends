A new function,  a shrinking function for debugging information,  was added.  By using this function,  the size of the present debugging information can be reduced to one-tenth approximately.  However,  PARTNER-N64/WIN Version 1.07 is necessary to utilize this function.  

'lba' command was added for 'mild'.

	An operating environment of exeGCC(N64) has been changed so that it can be operated
on WIN32 (a native environment for Windows 95, Windows NT).  So, it is possible to secure a memory of the system up to maximum virtual memory area.   Furthermore, it is now possible to create an environment to compile a program of N64 on Windows NT.

The size of debugging information was reduced to two-thirds approximately.   So,  the time for linking can be reduced.  

A shortage of a stack and a general protection error due to a complicated function or a large function, in case of  '-02' or '-03' option being specified and optimization being done when compiling,  are evaded. 
   
	'romalign' specification for delta transfer for 'mild' is now available.  Delta transfer
            function is now available if used with PARTNER-N64/Win Version 1.06.

'-w option' was added for 'mild'.   By this option specification,  it is possible to control a 
	warning display of 'overlapping' for 'mild'.

'-E option' was added for 'mild'.  By this option specification,  if an undefined symbol is found when 'mild' calls a linker (ld) and linking is being processed,  the processing stops 
at that moment.  

A directory specification by DOS environment drives or '\' for 'make' is available.
(It is now possible to describe c: \prog,x: \nintendo\kmc  etc.)
